This book is a combination of three lectures titled ‘Swami Vivekananda in San Francisco’ delivered extemporaneously by Swami Ashokananda at the Vedanta Society of Northern California in San Francisco. The author, an illumined soul himself, has brought out quite a few less known facts about the spiritual dimension of Swami Vivekananda. He describes Swami Vivekananda’s contribution to Vedanta and spirituality in India and America, and especially the high state of his mind when he was in San Francisco. This book will be of great benefit to the admirers of Swami Vivekananda to understand more about his personality and his mission in life.

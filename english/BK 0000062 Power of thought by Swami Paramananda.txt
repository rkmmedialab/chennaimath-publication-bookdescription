This powerful book by Swami Paramananda summarises the power of human thought and helps the readers harness it to attain higher goals. It emphasises the fact that the use and abuse of this force determines the destiny of every human being and that the whole life is nothing but the outer manifestation of the inner thought. It therefore underlies the need for right thinking and cultivating the practice of meditation to overcome obstacles in life.

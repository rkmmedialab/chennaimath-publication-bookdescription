Sri Ramakrishna is the consummation of millennia of Indian spiritual tradition. Swami Vivekananda regarded him as an Avatar and held that Satya Yuga had commenced from the day Sri Ramakrishna was born.
This book is a compilation of soothing and inspiring nectarine-like sayings of Sri Ramakrishna in the form of a daily quote, and when read, contemplated and practised every day, will improve the spiritual quality of the lives of the readers and remove the obstacles to God-realization in this modern and materialistic world.

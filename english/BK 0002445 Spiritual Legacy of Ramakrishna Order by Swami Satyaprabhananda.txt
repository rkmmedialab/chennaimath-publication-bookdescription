Although the name and activities of Ramakrishna Math and Mission are well-known in society, few are aware of the great personalities whose illuminating and inspiring lives form the spiritual legacy of the Ramakrishna Orderâ€”Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda and other direct disciples.
This book, authored by Swami Satyaprabhananda, a monk of the Ramakrishna Order, briefly yet lucidly narrates the life-stories of these great personalities for the benefit of those unacquainted with them.

This book by Swami Paramananda elucidates the enormous benefits that the practice of silence brings into our lives. The book emphasises that the aim of silence is not to free our mind from thought and assume a state of emptiness and passivity. Silence actually becomes a definite factor for our efficient and concentrated thought. It reiterates the fact that the greatest amount of good in the world is not done by a talker but by the one who has found the true centre of his or her being.
This book will help readers achieve mental poise in the midst of activity and achieve physical, moral and spiritual well-being.

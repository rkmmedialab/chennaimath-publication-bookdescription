Bhaja Govindam is one of the most popular hymns in religious literature rendered by Sri Shankaracharaya and his disciples. Originally called Moha Mudgara—the hammering of delusion—it contains the highest truths of Vedanta explained lucidly with exquisite poetical beauty.
This book contains the original verses with translations and explanations by Swami Gurudasananda, a monk residing in Sri Janaki Mata Ashram, Thanjavur. This book would greatly help all devotees and spiritual aspirants to get rid of their delusion and proceed towards the Reality.

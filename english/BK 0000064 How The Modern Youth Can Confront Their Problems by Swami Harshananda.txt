This tiny booklet by Swami Harshananda, a senior monk of the Ramakrishna Order, discusses the myriad problems—regionalism, communalism and casteism, bigoted religious leaders and their institutions, unscrupulous money-power, politics, smoking, bars and cinema houses and television—that plague the youth of today. This booklet will help the youth identify problems and find possible solutions.

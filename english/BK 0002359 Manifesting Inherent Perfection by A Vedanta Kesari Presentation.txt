This book, a collection of 50 writings, attempts to discuss the various aspects of education ‘in its widest sense’ and the ‘inside’ of education which is man-making. This book presents the Indian worldview of divinity of man and unity of existence. Compiled from the archives of The Vedanta Kesari, these writings deal with various aspects of education, particularly the key ideas of Yoga and Vedanta which are of great value to all educationists and students.
‘As long as I live, so long do I learn,’ said Sri Ramakrishna. This handy volume on education draws our attention to this fact through articles, stories and personal accounts of monks, teachers, students, scholars and commoners.
